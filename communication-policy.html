                              times. Additionally, changes made by your wireless carrier or service providers may impact the functionality of our communication services. CliQclose reserves the right

                         <h3 class="font-medium md:text-xl text-lg">Text Alert Enrollment</h3>
                         <p>CliQclose or one or more of its affiliates may offer access to messages related to your orders and product delivery service through CliQclose or its third-party vendors via
                              recurring SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Message Service) text alerts. To enroll in text alerts, you must provide your mobile phone number with an area
                              code. By enrolling, you agree to the following terms and conditions, which become effective upon your enrollment.</p>

                         <p>You have the option to stop receiving text alerts from CliQclose at any time. If you wish to unsubscribe from the order and delivery service text alerts, simply reply STOP
                              to any text message you receive, and you will be opted out of all future text messages. After unsubscribing, you may receive one final text alert from CliQclose
                              confirming that you will no longer receive text alerts. Unless you choose to re-activate your enrollment, no further text alerts will be sent to you.</p>

                         <h3 class="font-medium md:text-xl text-lg">Consent Requirements for Communication</h3>
                         <p>The consent requirements for communication with CliQclose’s clients vary depending on the type of conversation and its nature. Conversational SMS/text messaging refers to
                              one-on-one, two-way conversations between the company and its existing customers or known contacts with an established business relationship. In such cases, if a customer
                              initiates the conversation and the company promptly responds with relevant information, verbal or written permission is not required. This is known as implied consent.
                         </p>
                         <p>For informational SMS/text and voice recordings, the customer must provide their phone number and agree to be contacted in the future. In this case, explicit permission is
                              required for the company to send informational text messages. Customers can grant this permission through opt-in methods such as texting a keyword, filling out a form,
                              providing consent on a website, or giving verbal or written permission.</p>
                         <p>Promotional text messaging involves directly promoting, marketing, and selling the company’s business or services. Contacts must explicitly sign a form, check an online
                              box, or provide consent through other means to receive promotional text messages.</p>
                         <p>Text messages may include call-to-action (CTA) links or buttons that prompt recipients to take specific actions, such as paying invoices, opting in or out of text message
                              campaigns, accessing websites or web properties, connecting to calendars, and more.</p>
                         <p>CliQclose sends text messages to clients to explain their services, provide informational content, and promote their business. Clients can opt out of receiving these
                              messages by texting keywords like “STOP” or “UNSUBSCRIBE” or by expressing their disinterest during a call.</p>

                         <h3 class="font-medium md:text-xl text-lg">Call Recording and Monitoring</h3>
                         <p>CliQclose operates a telephone system that is capable of recording conversations for various legitimate purposes, including quality monitoring, training, compliance, and
                              safeguarding. All calls, both incoming and outgoing, may be recorded, retained, and collected.</p>
                         <p>Calls may be retrieved or monitored under specific circumstances, such as investigating a complaint, conducting quality checks, ensuring compliance with regulations,
                              protecting the health and safety of individuals, aiding employee training, and safeguarding purposes.</p>
                         <p>Personal data collected during call recording will be processed lawfully and in accordance with relevant legislation, including GDPR. The collected data will be adequate,
                              relevant, and not excessive, used only for the stated purposes, accessible to authorized personnel, handled confidentially, stored securely, and retained for no longer
                              than necessary before secure destruction.</p>
                         <p>Whenever possible, callers and recipients will be informed that the call is being monitored or recorded for quality or training purposes, allowing them the opportunity to
                              consent by continuing the call or hanging up.</p>
                         <p>By continuing a call and/or accepting the current policy, you agree to the monitoring or recording of the call for the purposes mentioned in this policy.</p>

                         <h3 class="font-medium md:text-xl text-lg">Dispute Resolution</h3>
                         <p>Except for small claims court disputes, any disputes arising from this Agreement or the relationship between you and CliQclose will be resolved through final and binding
                              arbitration. Both parties agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury. Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. The arbitration will be
                              administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under the Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement. The rules can be found online [insert
                              link]. The arbitrator will conduct hearings via teleconference or videoconference unless an in-person hearing is deemed necessary by the arbitrator or upon request by
                              either party. If an in-person hearing is required, it will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient for both parties, taking into account their ability to
                              travel and other relevant circumstances. If the parties cannot agree on a location, the AAA or the arbitrator will make the determination. The arbitrator’s decision will
                              be final and binding, following the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator will have the power to grant temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or specific
                              performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide appropriate relief for the individual claim being arbitrated. The arbitrator’s award can be
                              confirmed and enforced in any court with jurisdiction. However, this Agreement does not prevent you from reporting issues to federal, state, or local agencies, who may
                              seek relief against us on your behalf, if permitted by law.</p>
                         <p>Except for the language above regarding the waiver of class and representative actions, if a court determines that any part of this Dispute Resolution provision is invalid
                              or unenforceable, the remaining parts of this provision will still apply. If a court determines that the language related to the waiver of class and representative
                              actions is invalid or unenforceable, the entire Dispute Resolution provision will be null and void. The rest of the Agreement will remain in effect and unaffected by this
                              severability provision.</p>
